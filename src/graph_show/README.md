# GraphShow Tool
-----------------------------------------------
## Function
- Generally, the Graph.config file configuration may vary with services. There are many engines and the service logic is complex. It is difficult to understand the logical structure of the system by reading the config file. This tool displays the config file in graphics by using the visualization technology, which helps you to understand the logical structure of the service system.
